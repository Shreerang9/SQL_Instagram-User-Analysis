The provided SQL project focuses on analyzing user data in an Instagram-like application using various SQL skills. It consists of several queries that aim to extract insights from different aspects of user behavior.

Oldest Users (Q1): The first query retrieves the five oldest users of Instagram by sorting the 'users' table based on the 'created_at' column in ascending order. This allows identifying the earliest registered users.

Users with No Video Posts (Q2): The second query identifies users who have never posted a single video. It performs a right join between the 'photos' and 'users' tables on the 'user_id' column and filters out the rows where 'image_url' (representing a video post) is null. This way, it retrieves users who have never posted any videos.

Contest Winner (Q3): The third query aims to identify the winner of a contest by determining which photo received the highest number of likes. It combines data from the 'likes', 'photos', and 'users' tables using left joins. The result shows the username, user_id, and photo_id with the highest count of distinct user_ids in the 'likes' table, indicating the winning photo.

Top 5 Commonly Used Hashtags (Q4): The fourth query identifies the top five most commonly used hashtags. It joins the 'photo_tags' and 'tags' tables on 'tag_id' to count the occurrences of each tag and then sorts them in descending order by frequency.

Most Popular Registration Day (Q5): The fifth query determines the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. It uses the 'dayofweek()' function to extract the day from the 'created_at' column and then groups the data by the registration day, counting the number of distinct usernames for each day and sorting them in descending order.

Average User Posts and Total Photos per User (Q6): The sixth query calculates the average number of posts made by users on Instagram. It creates a temporary table named 'Frequency' by counting the number of posts (photos) for each user and then calculates the average using the 'AVG' function. Additionally, it calculates the total number of photos divided by the total number of users, providing an insight into the average contribution per user.

Users Who Liked Every Single Photo (Q7): The seventh query identifies users (possibly bots) who have liked every single photo on the platform. It performs a left join between the 'likes' and 'users' tables on 'user_id', groups the data by user_id, and filters for users with the exact count of 257 likes, representing all photos.

Overall, this project showcases the application of various SQL skills to analyze user data and gain valuable insights into user behavior on an Instagram-like platform.
